## Getting started


# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

Our systems purpose is to provide a platform for communication for users with shared interests, where they're able talk and share ideas. The users are able to create Threads within predefined sub-forums and leave comments in the form of posts on any of the Threads. Sub-forums are created by an administrator with special privilages.
